Instructions for TimeSpin:

1. Go to https://www.enthought.com/downloads/ and download Enthought Canopy installer and execute (64-bit or 32 bit, choose your flavor). I could not include the installer in here as the file is too big.
2. Execute "skde_ah_20140505.py" using python IDLE. It calculates the density value for each point in "AllCases2010.txt" and stores them in "AllCases_stkde.txt". All you need is math module.
3. Start Enthought Canopy software, open "scatterplot3d_rotation_stkde_ah_20140505.py" and execute using ctrl + r. 
4. Enjoy the visualization, spin, tilt, and pan the plot, change colors, shadows, background etc. 


notes:
- if you keep the file hierarchy as is and don't change any file paths in the scripts, they will all run smoothly.
